# DS-221 Project
This repository contains the semester project for the DS-221 course, which implements a grading system supporting both Absolute Grading and Relative Grading. The absolute grading system assigns grades based on predefined ranges of marks, while the relative grading system uses the Central Limit Theorem to calculate Z-Scores, enabling grade assignment based on statistical distribution. The program includes features for visualizing the marks distribution, such as plotting a histogram and overlaying it with a normal curve to aid in understanding the relative grading process.

## Dependencies
1. `tkinter` for the GUI
2. `pandas` for loading the dataset
3. `numpy` for calculating mean and standard deviation
4. `matplotlib` for plotting histograms
5. `scipy` for plotting normal curves
